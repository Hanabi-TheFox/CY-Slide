When you download our project, if you want to run it, you have to compile it with your IDE (we use Visual Studio Code for example). After doing that, u can run it thanks to your IDE or you can use a terminal command. For example, on Visual Studio Code, click on the little arrow next to the triangle button on the top right of the window, and click on "run on java". You have to install java on your computer if you don't see this. The command to run the program is "h:; cd 'h:\Documents\ING1\Semestre2\Projet\CY-Slide'; & 'C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-18.0.2.1\bin\java.exe' '@C:\Users\CYTECH~1\AppData\Local\Temp\cp_1sekzudm1ytm8d7b0lge9tyc7.argfile' '-m' 'com.cyslide/com.cyslide.CySlideApplication'". Be careful to the path of your files it depends on where you put them. The command above comes from a terminal under Windows.
