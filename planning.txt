    Class diagram.
    Creation of the JavaFX project base (MVC method).
    Sequence diagram.
    Creation planning.

    Documentation on javaFX.
  Clement - Yanis - Samy:
    Try to fix JavaFX technical  problem on their computer.

Tuesday, May 16:
  Ethan - Clement - Renato - Samy - Yanis:
    Vocal with Eva Ansermin, the tutor to ask questions.
  Renato - Yanis:
    Work on the base java class of the project.
  Samy:
    Work on java functions to move tile + adjustment of some class
    (Tile, EmptyTile, NumberTile, IndestructibleTile).
  Ethan - Yanis - Renato:
    Work on the view part of the project.
  Ethan:
    Creating the Data files.
    Organize a meeting with Romuald Grignon for technical help.
  Clement:
    Search for resolution algorithm of the teasing game.
    Work on function in order to recover our data file from java class.

Wednesday, May 17:
  Ethan - Clement - Renato - Samy - Yanis:
    Vocal with Romuald Grignon in order to help us on JavaFX.
  Ethan: 
    work on view, he designed the prototype of a level (level 0)
    and test the designed of all type of tiles (level X).
    work on view's button event.
  Samy: 
    work on 'recover' functions, now we can create a table of tile with our file csv
    and recover the record of a level.
  Clement:
    Work on controller. If the pseudo doesn't exist, we write his pseudo in our csv file
    and if the pseudo exits, we recover the number of completed level.
    Continue his search on the AI (he have to wait others functions to use AI).
  Renato:
    Worked on javaFX, create back button on menu view
    Started to make level X (in view).
  Yanis:
    Work on javaFX. create event and movement for rectangle figure.
    
Thursday, May 18:
  Samy:
    tests function level.move, move (NumberTile) and move (EmptyTile)
    with a table from a file level.csv and makes the necessary modifications.
    Helps Yanis to create a table of type Rectangle in order to create a view 
    from a file level.csv.
  Clement:
    Creates a function to recover the number of completed level by a player from a csv file. 
    Continues his work with the automatic resolution (he try to use AStar).
  Renato: 
  The issue with the CSV file path has been resolved. Update on the LevelX view.
  Started working on creating a class for dynamically generating the game table.
  Yanis:
    Working on the integration of the new method of graphic generation of levels.
    
Friday, May 19:
  Samy:
    Create function isCompleted() in level.java.
    (Tries to understand file RectangleWithLabel.java and RectangleDragHandler.java)
    Changes 'move' functions in order to use them with RectangleWithLabel table.
    Starts search on a* algorithm.
  Clement:
    Work on AStarAlgo, solve problems like the Manhattan Distance
    Try to fix other problem like the infinite loop in the terminal (for test before to use it)
  Renato: 
    QuitButton and fixed printing tiles in order. Worked on tile movement.
  Yanis:
    worked on the resolution of issues in the movement of the tiles.
  
Monday, May 22:
  Ethan - Clement - Renato - Samy - Yanis:
    Teams Reunion with Romuald Grignon in order to help us with our problem with 
    variables in our file controller. (That’s have been done in the end of the day)
  Samy:
    Create the function initLevelMove() in level.java but can't test it because 
    we need to use a RectangleWithLabel table, so we need to succeed at link 
    the function with the interface.
    Try to link the function with the interface but we don't know why we can't.
    After the meeting, works on adjustment on function initLevelMove()
    because now he can test it.
  Clement:
    Works a lot in order to use A* in our programme.
    Try to fix problems
  Renato: 
    Worked on play Button, A* Algorithm and Player Class.
    Encountered problems with Controller variables.
  Yanis:
    Work on keyboard movement for tiles
    Help for A* algorithm
    "Try" to fix move counter
  Ethan:
    Try to rework entirely the generation of the LevelX.fxml
    for a proper code but It doesn't succeed.
    Rework completely the player class.
    Have greatly optimized the code of the CySlideController class.
    (more than 100 lines of code removed)
    Have improved the visual of the game.
    Now the level number is displayed in the game view.
    
Tuesday, May 23:
  Ethan - Clement - Renato - Samy - Yanis:
    Teams Reunion with Eva Ansermin in order to help us on our problem with A* algorithm.
  Samy:
    Help to use Level class in our A* algorithm.
    Works on function initLevelMove. Now we use seeds and with this,
    2 players can play the same level 2 for example.
  Clement:
    Work in AStarAlgo with a new version, instead of using the distance of Manhattan,
    use the number of misplaced tiles
    Try to implements this new version but always problems with the movement of tiles
  Renato: 
    Implemented a feature to add block levels based on the resolution.
  Yanis:
    Work on keyboard movement for tiles.
    Help for A* algorithm.
    "Try" to help fix move counter.
  Ethan: 
    Created a controller event for each time a Drag&Drop is done.
    (Spend a lot of time on it because nobody in the group knows how to do that.)
    The counter of movement is now displayed in the game view.
    Because of the Drag&Drop triggering event.
    Correction of the system of level unlocking and debugging some functions.


Wednesday, May 24:
  Samy - Clement - Yanis:
    Continue to fix problems in A* Algo and succeed to use it when we have a level
    with one empty tile.
  Renato:
    Worked on the isCompleted() method to check if the player has completed the game,
    and also conducted research on how to include audio files in the application.
  Ethan : 
    Do a lot of debugging, add a lot of conditions on some functions associated with the 
    application because they were able to trigger in inappropriate situations and
    the function that changed the data of Record wasn’t working.
    Also correct the “IsCompleted” event.
    Made the locked and unlocked level visible on the application view.
    Start to write the main part of the javaDoc of the entire code and delete
    a lot of unnecessary code or comments.


Thursday, May 25:
  Clément
    Work on AStar Algo in order to work with more empty tile
    Modify sequence and class diagrams
    Make Use Case diagram
  Ethan : 
    Debug the resolve problem on the application.
    The algorithm works but it wasn’t taking the good matrix on the controller.
    Create the MatrixToLevel function to patch that.
    And now the turn counter increases while the I.A auto-resolves the matrix.
    (For a best visual feedback in the game)
    Work on the report document.
  Renato:
    Worked on blocking resolve button and play button in the level view.
    Helped on user case and class diagram.
  Samy : 
	  Working on the initLevelMove function, now after mixing
    we can't have the tiles on their initial position.
    Modify the skeleton of our levels to make A* easier to use
    (we don't want it to take too long)
    Helps debug the use of A* with the program interface
   
Friday, May 26, Saturday, May 27 and Sunday, May 28:
  Samy, Clement and Yanis:
    Try to add some optional feature like music, sound effect
    or use picture instead of number (to do like a puzzle).
  Renato: Generated Javadoc
  All the group :
    last adjustments on the project.
    (Javadoc, comments, delete useless code, ...)
    And complete the readme file and the report.
